A device MAY restrict the allowed values for this leaf,

For system-controlled interfaces, this leaf is the
device-specific name of the interface.

If a client tries to create configuration for a
system-controlled interface that is not present in the
operational state, the server MAY reject the request if
the implementation does not support pre-provisioning of
interfaces or if the name refers to an interface that can
never exist in the system.  A Network Configuration
Protocol (NETCONF) server MUST reply with an rpc-error
with the error-tag 'invalid-value' in this case.

If the device supports pre-provisioning of interface
configuration, the 'pre-provisioning' feature is
advertised.

If the device allows arbitrarily named user-controlled
interfaces, the 'arbitrary-names' feature is advertised.

When a configured user-controlled interface is created by
the system, it is instantiated with the same name in the
operational state.
