#lighty test report aggregator
This module merges jacoco code coverage results from lighty.io modules to overall coverage. The modules from which the 
coverage is created are defined in the pom file dependencies. 

Overall code coverage result can be found in `targets/site/jacoco-aggregate` folder after lighty.io build.
